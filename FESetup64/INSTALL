Installation
============


1) Download the appropriate package from
http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/ccpbiosim/frs/
There are packages for 32bit and 64bit Intel Linux.  If the follwing command
yields "x86_64" you will need the 64bit version.

    	> uname -m
        

2) Unpack the compressed tar archive in a convenient location.  NN in the
following is either 32 or 64 (for 32 or 64bit).

    	> cd /where/I/want/it		# replace the path to whatever you like
    	> tar xfvj FESetupNN.tar.bz2	# all files to the directory FESetupNN/
    	> cd FESetupNN/			# replace NN with 32 or 64
    	> FES_HOME=`pwd`		# FES_HOME only needed for convenience
        

3) Check FESetupNN/bin/FESetup with your favourite editor if any of the
environment variables need to be changed.  Point AMBERHOME to the location of
your AMBER installation.  Our packages come with all relevant tools from the
AmberTools 13 distribution but we cannot distribute sander as this requires a
full AMBER license.  Sander is needed if you want to do minimisation or MD.
Alternatively, you can use NAMD for this purpose but note that currently we do
not support any of its free energy methods.  Point the environment variable
NAMDHOME to the location where the executable namd2 is located.  All other
environment variables already point to the right location and should not be
changed.


4) For ease of use you may want to create a link somewhere in your PATH to
$FES_HOME/bin/FESetup, e.g.

    	> ln -s $FES_HOME/bin/FESetup /usr/local/bin
        

5) Check that you have all dependent software installed: Python 2.7, optionally
AmberTools 13 plus AMBER , and/or optionally NAMD. 


6) Check that FESetup is working.  You can do that by running the test set from
our first tutorial:
