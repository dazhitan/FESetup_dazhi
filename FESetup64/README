FESetup
=======


FESetup is a tool that automises setup of protein-ligand free energy
simulations like thermodynamic integration (TI) and MM-PBSA.  The tool will
automatically parameterise the ligands (AM1/BCC) and map mutational pairs.
Supported molecular simulation packages are Sire[1] and AMBER[2].  Supported
force fields are all modern AMBER force fields including GAFF.  Future plans
include extending the code to support other popular biomolecular simulation
software, additional force fields and parameterisation schemes.  We particulary
aim at ease of use and robustness of the code.

The code is written in Python 2.7 and comes in a self-contained bzip2
compressed tar archive.
